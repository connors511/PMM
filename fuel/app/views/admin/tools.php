		<h2>Export</h2>
		<p>From the tools panel, you can export all images, subtitles
		and NFO files, either seperately or at the same time.</p>
		<p>You can also choose to export for all movies, or handpick
		which ones you want to export for.</p>

	<div class="span4">
		<h2>Rename</h2>
		<p>It is also possible to rename your movie files with either
		static file names or by using the powerful dynamic syntax
		supported by PMM.</p>
		<p>All fields and relations between elements related to a movie
		can be used in the filename or path when renaming or moving files.</p>
		<p>When moving or renaming files, all related files are moved
		with the movie file, so you do not end up with orphans!</p>
